# AI-voice-assistant
The initial idea for this voice assistant was to be able to have a natural conversation with an AI assistant that uses speech to speech as a primary interface and is able to assist with specific tasks. A specific task we had in mind was to create a short 3 minute executive summary for a project showcase. The exec summary would include spoken narration by the AI assistant, and a visual medium such as a powerpoint slide or a video.
