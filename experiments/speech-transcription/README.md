# Speech Transcription experiment

To run this python program, you'll need to do the following:
1. Review the python code and modify the section where the WhisperModel is called to suit whether you want to use CPU or GPU acceleration. GPU is better.
2. Run `pip install faster-whisper`
3. Run `pip install pyaudio`
4. Run `pip install wave`
5. Run `python test2.py` You can optionally call it with an audio file at the end to have that transcribed.
